# Strapi Starter Gatsby Catalog

This starter allows you to create a Catalog using Gatsby with a Strapi backend. This starter, and its associated template, uses musical instruments as sample seed data, but it could be customized for any product.

This is an open source project. Feel free contribute by adding features and reporting bugs.

## Features

- 2 Collection types: Product, Catgory
- Specifications component for products
- Related products
- Local Search using [gatsby-plugin-local-search](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-local-search/)
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS

## Getting started

The easiest way to try this starter is to run it locally on your computer.

First, you will need to create your own copy of the starter by clicking [the "Use this template" button](https://github.com/strapi/strapi-starter-gatsby-catalog/generate) on GitHub, and completing the [form](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

### Backend

Create a Strapi project named `backend` using the [catalog template](https://github.com/strapi/strapi-template-catalog):

```
# Using Yarn
yarn create strapi-app backend --template https://github.com/strapi/strapi-template-catalog

# Or using NPM
npx create-strapi-app backend --template https://github.com/strapi/strapi-template-catalog
```

The Strapi server will automatically start and import sample seed data.

### Frontend

Leave the Strapi backend running in the background. Open another terminal tab, and make sure you're in the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Then install dependencies and start the server:

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn install
yarn develop

# Using npm
npm install
npm run develop
```

The Gatsby server will run here => [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
